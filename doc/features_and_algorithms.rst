Features and algorithms
=======================

This Page gives a quick overview of the algorithms used.  We have
written a paper [Mor05]_, where *all* the details can be found.

Introduction
============

Using the projector-augmented wave (PAW)
method [Blo94]_, [Blo03]_  allows us to get rid of the core
electrons and work with soft pseudo valence wave functions.  The
pseudo wave functions don't need to be normalized - this is important
for the efficiency of calculations involving 2. row elements (such as
oxygen) and transition metals.  A further advantage of the PAW method
is that it is an all-electron method (frozen core approximation) and
there is a one to one transformation between the pseudo and
all-electron quantities.



Grids
=====

Pseudo wave functions, pseudo electron densities and potentials are
represented on uniform real-space orthorhombic grids.  Two kinds of
grids are involved in the calculations: A coarse grid used for the
wave functions and a fine grid (:math:`2^3=8` times higher grid point
density) used for densities and potentials.  The pseudo electron
density is first calculated on the coarse grid from the wave
functions, and then interpolated to the fine grid, where compensation
charges are added for achieving normalization.  The effective
potential is evaluated on the fine grid (solve the Poisson equation
and calculate the exchange-correlation potential) and then restricted
to the coarse grid where it needs to act on the wave functions (also on
the coarse grid).


Multi-grid techniques
=====================

The Poisson equation is solved using a standard multi-grid solver.
Solving the Kohn-Sham equation is done via the "residual minimization
method - direct inversion in iterative subspace" (RMM-DIIS)
method [Kre96]_.  A good starting guess for the wave functions is obtained
by diagonalizing a Hamiltonian for the subspace of atomic orbitals.
We use the multi-grid preconditioner described by Briggs *et
al.* [Bri96]_ for the residuals, and standard Pulay
mixing is used to update the density.



Compensation charges
====================

Compensation charges
are expanded to give correct multipole moments up to angular momentum
number :math:`\ell=2`.


Boundary conditions
===================

In each of the three directions, the boundary conditions can be either
periodic or open.


Mask function technique
=======================

Due to the discreticed nature of space in finite difference methods,
the energy of an atom will depend on its position relative to the grid
points.  The problem comes from the calculation of the integral of a
wave function times an atom centered localized function (radial
functions times a spherical harmonic).  To reduce this dependence, we
use the technique of [Taf06]_, where the radial functions (projector functions) are smoothened as follows:

* Divide function by a mask function that goes smoothly to zero at
  approximately twice the cutoff radius.
* Fourier transform.
* Cut off short wavelength components.
* Inverse Fourier transform.
* Multiply by mask function.


Exchange-correlation functionals
================================

All the functionals from the :ref:`libxc <xc_functionals>` library can
be used.  Calculating the XC-energy and potential for the extended
pseudo density is simple.  For GGA functionals, a nearest neighbor
finite difference stencil is used for the gradient operator.  In the
PAW method, there is a correction to the XC-energy inside the
augmentation spheres.  The integration is done on a non-linear radial
grid - very dense close to the nuclei and less dense away from the
nuclei.

Parallelization
===============

Parallelization is done by distributing **k**-points, spins, and bands
over all processors and on top of that domain-decomposition is used.


ASE interface
=============

The code has been designed to work together with the atomic
simulation environment (:ase:`ASE <>`). ASE provides:

 * Structure optimization.
 * Molecular dynamics.
 * Nudged elastic band calculations.
 * Maximally localized Wannier functions.
 * Scanning tunneling microscopy images.
 * Transport calculations.
