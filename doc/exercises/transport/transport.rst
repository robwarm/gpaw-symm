==================
Electron transport
==================

This exercise shows how to use the ase transport module for performing
realistic calculations of the electron transport in nanoscale contacts.

The exercise demonstrates the use of the classes:

* :class:`~ase.transport.calculators.TransportCalculator` used to
  calculate transmission functions.
* :class:`GPAWTransport` used to extract realistic descriptions of
  real systems using the GPAW DFT-LCAO mode.

First-time users of the ASE transport module, should start by reading
the methodology in the :ase:`ASE manual <ase/transport/transport.html>`.

Recent experiments suggests that a hydrogen molecule trapped between
metal electrodes has a conductance close to the quantum unit of
conductance (`1G_0=2e^2/h`).  As a managable model for this system, we
consider a hydrogen molecule sandwiched between semi-infinite one
dimensional Pt leads as shown in the figure below

This is the system considered in the rest of the exercise.


Tight-binding description
=========================

In this part of the exercise, we illustrate the use of the ASE
transport module, by means of a simple tight-binding (TB) model for
the Pt-H2-Pt system, with only one TB site per atom.

As explained in the :ase:`ASE manual <ase/transport/transport.html>`,
we need need to define a principal layer, and a scattering region. To
be able to describe second nearest neighbor hopping, we choose a
principal layer of two Pt atoms. The scattering region is chosen
minimal: i.e. the molecule plus one principal layer on each side, as
marked with a square on the figure above.

To describe both the principal layer and the coupling between such
layers (which is also the coupling from the leads into the scattering
region), we define a lead Hamiltonian consisting of two principal
layers + coupling:

.. math::

    H_\text{lead} = \begin{pmatrix}
                       H_L & V \\
                       V^\dagger & H_{L}
                    \end{pmatrix}

Assuming an onsite energy equal to the fermi energy, a nearest
neighbor hopping energy of -1, and second nearest neighbor hopping of
0.2, the lead Hamiltonian may be constructed like this::

    import numpy as np
    H_lead = np.array([[ 0. , -1. ,  0.2,  0. ],
	                [-1. ,  0. , -1. ,  0.2],
                        [ 0.2, -1. ,  0. , -1. ],
                        [ 0. ,  0.2, -1. ,  0. ]])
    
Next, the Hamiltonian for the scattering region should be constructed.
Assuming the Hydrogen molecule can be described by the Hamiltonian:

.. math::

    H_\text{mol} = \begin{pmatrix}
                       0 & -0.8 \\
                       -0.8 & 0
                    \end{pmatrix}

and that the molecule only couples to the nearest Pt atom, with a
hopping energy of 0.2: Write down the explicit scattering Hamiltonian
(it is a `6 \times 6` matrix).

You are now ready to initialize the ``TransportCalculator``::
    
    from ase.transport.calculators import TransportCalculator

    tcalc = TransportCalculator(h=H_scat,  # Scattering Hamiltonian
                                h1=H_lead, # Lead 1 (left)
                                h2=H_lead, # Lead 2 (right)
                                pl=2)      # principal layer size

To calculate the transmission function; first select an energy grid
for the transmission, then run ``tcalc.get_transmission()``::

    tcalc.set(energies=npy.arange(-3, 3, 0.02))
    T_e = tcalc.get_transmission()

Try to plot the transmission function (e.g. using
``pylab.plot(tcalc.energies, T_e)``).

The projected density of states (pdos) for the two hydrogen TB sites
can be calculated using::

    tcalc.set(pdos=[0, 1])
    pdos_ne = tcalc.get_pdos()
    
Note that all indices in ``TransportCalculator`` refers to the
scattering region minus the mandatory principal layer on each side.
Why do you think the pdos of each the hydrogen TB sites has two peaks?

To investigate the system you can try to diagonalize the subspace
spanned by the hydrogen TB sites::

    h_rot, s_rot, eps_n, vec_nn = tcalc.subdiagonalize_bfs([0, 1])
    tcalc.set(h=h_rot, s=s_rot) # Set the rotated matrices

``eps_n[i]`` and ``vec_nn[:,i]`` contains the i'th eigenvalue and
eigenvector of the hydrogen molecule.  Try to calculate the pdos
again. What happpened?

You can try to remove the coupling to the bonding state and calculate
the calculate the transmission function::
    
    tcalc.cutcupling_bfs([0])
    T_cut_bonding_e = tcalc.get_transmission()

You may now understand the transport behavior of the simple model
system.  The transmission peak at -0.8 eV and 0.8 eV are due to the
bonding and antibonding states of the TB described hydrogen molecule.
A script containing the above can be found here: :svn:`~doc/exercises/transport/pt_h2_tb_transport.py`.

DFT description
===============

We now continue to explore the Pt-H2-Pt system using a more realistic
desciption derived from ab-initio calculations.

The functions :class:`get_lcao_hamiltonian` and
:class:`get_lead_lcao_hamiltonian` (in gpaw.lcao.tools) allows you to
construct such a Hamiltonian within DFT in terms of pseudo atomic orbitals.
Since real potential decay much slower than in our TB model, we increase the
principal layers to 4 Pt atoms, and the scattering region to 5 Pt atoms on
either side.  To obtain the matrices for the scattering region and the leads
using DFT and pseudo atomic orbitals using a szp basis set run this
:svn:`~doc/exercises/transport/pt_h2_lcao_manual.py`:

.. literalinclude:: pt_h2_lcao_manual.py

You should now have the files scat_hs.pickle, lead1_hs.pickle and
lead2_hs.pickle in your directory.  These can be loaded and used in
the ``TransportCalculator``::
    
    from ase.transport.calculators import TransportCalculator
    import pickle

    #Read in the hamiltonians
    h, s = pickle.load(file('scat_hs.pickle'))
    h1, s1 = pickle.load(file('lead1_hs.pickle'))
    h2, s2 = pickle.load(file('lead2_hs.pickle'))

    tcalc = TransportCalculator(h=h, h1=h1, h2=h2, # hamiltonian matrices
                                s=s, s1=s1, s2=s2, # overlap matrices
                                align_bf=1)        # align the Fermi levels

In SZP there are 4 basis functions per H atom, and 9 per Pt atom. Does
the size of the different matrices match your expectations?  What is
the conductance? Does it agree with the experimental value?
    
We will now try to investigate transport properties in more detail.
Try to subdiagonalize the molecular subspace::
   
    Pt_N = 5
    Pt_nbf = 9 # number of bf per Pt atom (basis=szp)
    H_nbf = 4  # number of bf per H atom (basis=szp)
    bf_H1 = Pt_nbf * Pt_N
    bfs = range(bf_H1, bf_H1 + 2 * H_nbf)
    h_rot, s_rot, eps_n, vec_jn = tcalc.subdiagonalize_bfs(bfs)
    for n in range(len(eps_n)):
        print 'bf %i correpsonds to the eigenvalue %.2f eV' % (bfs[n],eps_n[n])

Argue that ``vec_jn[:,0]`` and ``vec_jn[:,1]`` corresponds to the bonding and 
anti-bonding molecular hydrogen orbitals, respectively. 

What is the calculated band-gap of the hydrogen-molecule?

Switch to the rotated basis set (``tcalc.set(h=h_rot, s=s_rot)``) then
plot the transmission function end the projected density of states of
the renormalized molecular orbitals in an energy range of say -8 to 4
eV.

Which orbital do you think is responsible for the high conductance?
Try to cut the relevant orbitals from the basis set, as we did for the
TB model.
