Calculation of electronic band structures
=========================================

In this tutorial we calculate the electronic band structure of Si along
high symmetry directions in the Brillouin zone.

First, a standard ground state calculations is performed and the results
are saved to a *.gpw* file. As we are dealing with small bulk system, 
plane wave mode is the most appropriate here.

    :lines: 7-22

Next, :mod:`ase.dft.kpoints` module is used for generating k-points along
the high symmetry directions in the Brillouin zone. The below figure shows 
the high symmetry points of few common crystal lattices.

For the band structure calculation, density is fixed to the previously
calculated ground state density (``fixdensity=True``), and as we want to
calculate all k-points, symmetry is not used (``usesymm=None``). The
unoccupied states can be sometimes converged faster with the conjugate gradient
eigensolver.

    :lines: 24-41

Finally, the bandstructure can be plotted e.g. with matplotlib. 
The :func:`ase.dft.kpoints.get_bandpath` provides in addition to the 
actual k-points information which is useful for plotting.
