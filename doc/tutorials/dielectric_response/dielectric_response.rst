Linear dielectric response of an extended system: tutorial
==========================================================

A short introduction
=====================

The DielectricFunction object can calculate the dielectric function of an 
extended system from its ground state electronic structure. The frequency and 
wave-vector dependent linear dielectric matrix in reciprocal space 
representation is written as

.. math:: \epsilon_{\mathbf{G} \mathbf{G}^{\prime}}(\mathbf{q}, \omega)

where `\mathbf{q}` and  `\omega` are the momentum and energy 
transfer in an excitation, and `\mathbf{G}` is reciprocal lattice 
vector. The off-diagonal element of 
`\epsilon_{\mathbf{G} \mathbf{G}^{\prime}}` determines the local field 
effect. 

The macroscopic dielectric function is defined by (with local field correction)

.. math:: \epsilon_{M}(\mathbf{q},\omega) = 
              \frac{1}{\epsilon^{-1}_{00}(\mathbf{q},\omega)}

Ignoring the local field (the off-diagonal element of dielectric matrix) 
results in:

.. math::  \epsilon_{M}(\mathbf{q},\omega) = \epsilon_{00}(\mathbf{q},\omega)

Optical absorption spectrum is obtained through

.. math:: \mathrm{ABS} = \mathrm{Im} 
              \epsilon_{M}(\mathbf{q} \rightarrow 0,\omega) 

Electron energy loss spectrum (EELS) is get by

.. math:: \mathrm{EELS} = -\mathrm{Im} 
              \frac{1}{\epsilon_{M}(\mathbf{q},\omega)}

The macroscopic dielectric function is ill defined for systems of 
reduced dimensionality. In these cases `\epsilon_M = 1.0`. The 
polarizability will maintain its structure for lower dimensionalities 
and is in 3D related to the macroscopic dielectric function as,

.. math:: \mathrm{Im} \epsilon_{M}(\mathbf{q},\omega) = 
              4 \, \pi \, \mathrm{Im} \alpha_M(\mathbf{q},\omega)

Refer to :ref:`df_theory`  for detailed documentation on theoretical part. 


Frequency grid
==============

The dielectric function is evaluted on a non-linear frequency grid according 
to the formula

.. math::
    
    \omega_i = i \frac{\Delta\omega_0}
    {1 -(\sqrt2 - 1)\frac{\Delta\omega_0}{\omega_2} i},
    i = 0, 1, ..., 

The parameter `\Delta\omega_0` is the frequency spacing at `\omega=0` and
`\omega_2` is the frequency where the spacing has increased to
`2\Delta\omega_0`. In general a lower value of `\omega_2` gives a more non-
linear grid and less frequency points.
   
Below, the frequency grid is visualized for different values of 
`\omega_2`. You can find the script for reproducing this figure here: 
:download:`plot_freq.py`.

.. image:: nl_freq_grid.png
    :align: center

The parameters can be specified using keyword arguments::

    df = DielectricFunction(...,
                            domega0=0.05,   # eV. Default = 0.1
                            omega2=5.0,     # Default = 10.0
                            omegamax=15.0)  # eV. Default is the maximum  
                                            #  difference between energy
                                            #  eigenvalues
                     
Setting ``omegamax`` manually is usually not advisable, however you
might want it in cases where semi-core states  are included where very large
energy eigenvalue differences appear.


Example 1: Optical absorption of semiconductor: Bulk silicon
============================================================

A simple startup
----------------

Here is a minimum script to get an absorption spectrum.

.. literalinclude:: silicon_ABS_simpleversion.py

This script takes less than one minute on a single cpu, and generates a file
'df.csv' containing the optical (`\mathbf{q} = 0`) dielectric function
along the x-direction, which is the default direction. The file 'df.csv'
contain five columns ordered as follows: `\omega` (eV),
`\mathrm{Re}(\epsilon_{\mathrm{NLF}})`,
`\mathrm{Im}(\epsilon_{\mathrm{NLF}})`,
`\mathrm{Re}(\epsilon_{\mathrm{LF}})`,
`\mathrm{Im}(\epsilon_{\mathrm{LF}})` where
`\epsilon_{\mathrm{NLF}}` and `\epsilon_{\mathrm{LF}}` is the
result without and with local field effects, respectively.

For other directions you can specify the direction and filename like::

 DielectricFunction.get_dielectric_function(...,
                                            direction='y',
                                            filename='filename.csv',
                                            ...) 

The absorption spectrum along the x-direction including local field effects 
can then be plotted using

.. literalinclude:: plot_silicon_ABS_simple.py

The resulting figure is shown below. Note that there is significant
absorption close to `\omega=0` because of the large default
Fermi-smearing in GPAW. This will be dealt with in the following more realistic
calculation.

.. image:: si_abs.png
    :align: center


More realistic calculation
--------------------------

To get a realistic silicon absorption spectrum and macroscopic dielectric 
constant, one needs to converge the calculations with respect to grid 
spacing, kpoints, number of bands, planewave cutoff energy and so on. Here 
is an example script: :download:`silicon_ABS.py`. In the following, the script 
is split into different parts for illustration.

1. Ground state calculation

  .. literalinclude:: silicon_ABS.py
      :lines: 1-39
  
  In this script a normal ground state calculation is performed with coarse 
  kpoint grid. The calculation is then restarted with a fixed density and the 
  full hamiltonian is diagonalized exactly on a densely sampled kpoint grid. 
  This is the preferred procedure of obtained the excited KS-states because it 
  is in general difficult to converge the excited states using iterative 
  solvers. A full diagonalization is more robust.

  .. note::

    For semiconductors, it is better to use either small Fermi-smearing in the 
    ground state calculation::
    
      from gpaw import FermiDirac
      calc = GPAW(...
                  occupations=FermiDirac(0.001),
                  ...)
   
    or larger ftol, which determines the threshold for transition  
    in the dielectric function calculation (`f_i - f_j > ftol`), not 
    shown in the example script)::
    
       df = DielectricFunction(...
                               ftol=1e-2,
                               ...)

2. Get absorption spectrum

  .. literalinclude:: silicon_ABS.py
      :lines: 41-45

  Here ``eta`` is the broadening parameter of the calculation, and ``ecut`` 
  is the local field effect cutoff included in the dielectric function.  

3. Get macroscopic dielectric constant

  The macroscopic dielectric constant is defined as the real part of dielectric 
  function at `\omega=0`.   In the following script, only a single 
  point at `\omega=0` is calculated without using the hilbert transform
  (which is only compatible with the non-linear frequency grid specification).

  .. literalinclude:: silicon_ABS.py
      :lines: 47-66
      :language: python
  
  In general, local field correction will reduce this value by 10-20%.

The arrows are data extracted from \ [#Kresse]_. 

The calculated macroscopic dielectric constant can be seen in the table below 
and compare good with the values from [#Kresse]_. The experimental value is 
11.90. The larger theoretical value results from the fact that the ground 
state LDA (even GGA) calculation underestimates the bandgap.

Example 2: Electron energy loss spectra
=======================================

Electron energy loss spectra (EELS) can be used to explore the plasmonic 
(collective electronic) excitations of an extended system. This is because 
the energy loss of a fast electron passing by a material is defined by

.. math:: \mathrm{EELS} = -\mathrm{Im} \frac{1}{\epsilon(\mathbf{q}, \omega)}

and the plasmon frequency `\omega_p` is defined as when 
`\epsilon(\omega_p) \rightarrow 0`. It means that an external 
perturbation at this frequency, even infinitesimal, can generate large 
collective electronic response. 

A simple startup: bulk aluminum
-------------------------------

Here is a minimum script to get an EELS spectrum. 

.. literalinclude:: aluminum_EELS.py

This script takes less than one minute on a single cpu and by default, 
generates a file 'EELS.csv'. Then you can plot the file using

.. literalinclude:: plot_aluminum_EELS_simple.py

The three columns of this file correspond to energy (eV), EELS without and 
with local field correction, respectively. You will see a 15.9 eV peak. 
It comes from the bulk plasmon excitation of aluminum. You can explore the 
plasmon dispersion relation  `\omega_p(\mathbf{q})` by 
tuning `\mathbf{q}` in the calculation above. 

.. image:: aluminum_EELS.png
    :height: 300 px
    :align: center

.. Note::

    The momentum transfer `\mathbf{q}` in an EELS calculation must be 
    the difference between two kpoints! For example, if you have an 
    kpts=(Nk1, Nk2, Nk3) Monkhorst-Pack k-sampling in the ground state 
    calculation, you have to choose 
    `\mathbf{q} = \mathrm{np.array}([i/Nk1, j/Nk2, k/Nk3])`, where  
    `i, j, k` are integers. 
    

A more sophisticated example: graphite
--------------------------------------

Here is a more sophisticated example of calculating EELS of graphite with
different  `\mathbf{q}`.  You can also get the script here:
:svn:`~doc/tutorials/dielectric_response/graphite_EELS.py`. The results
(plot) are shown in the following section.

.. literalinclude:: graphite_EELS.py


Results on graphite
-------------------

The figure shown here is generated from script: :download:`graphite_EELS.py` and 
:download:`plot_EELS.py`

.. image:: graphite_EELS.png
           :height: 500 px

One can compare the results with literature  \ [#Rubio]_.


Parallelization scheme
======================

XXX Rewrite. Three parallelization schemes over kpoints, spectral_function
and frequency  are used in the response function calculation.

Define the parsize for these three schemes as k-parsize, s-parsize and
w-parsize and the total number of cpus as world-size. They satisfy such
relations::

    world-size = k-parsize * s-parsize 
    world-size = w-parsize (if number of w >= world_size)

The parallelization over kpoints and frequency are highly efficient (close to
100% efficiency),  while the parallelization over spectral function need more
communications. By default,  only the first two parallelization schemes are
used.

But in case of large planewave energy cutoff, the spectral function is too
large to be stored on  a single cpu, the parallelization over spectral
function will be initialized automatically.

There is an input parameter ``kcommsize``, but it's better NOT to specify it
and let the  system decides the best option.

You can also view the parallelization scheme in the output file. 


Useful tips
===========

Use dry_run option to get an overview of a calculation (especially useful for heavy calculations!):: 
       
    python filename.py --gpaw=df_dry_run=8

If you are only interested in the low energy excitations (Ex: around the bandgap of a semiconductor), 
use LCAO mode can make the ground state calculation much faster without losing accuracy in the spectrum::

    calc = GPAW(...
                mode='lcao',
                basis='dzp'
                ...)

.. Note ::

    But be careful ! LCAO mode calculation results in unreliable unoccupied states above vacuum energy. 

It's important to converge the results with respect to::

    nbands, 
    nkpt (number of kpoints in gs calc.), 
    eta, 
    ecut, 
    ftol,
    omegamax (the maximum energy, be careful if hilbert transform is used)
    domega0 (the energy spacing, if there is)
    vacuum (if there is)
