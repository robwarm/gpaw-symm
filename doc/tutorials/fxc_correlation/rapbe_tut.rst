Correlation energies from TDDFT
===============================

The Random Phase Approximation (RPA) for correlation energies comprises a nice non-empirical expression for the correlation energy that can be naturally combined with exact exchange to calculate binding energies. Due to the non-local nature of the approximation, RPA gives a good account of dispersive forces and is the only xc approximation capable of describing intricate binding regimes where covalent and van der Waals interactions are equally important. However, RPA does not provide a very accurate description of strong covalent bonds and typically performs worse than standard GGA functionals for molecular atomization energies and cohesive energies of solids.

In general, the exact correlation energy can be expressed in terms of the exact response function as 

.. math::

  E_c = -\int_0^{\infty}\frac{d\omega}{2\pi}\int_0^1d\lambda\text{Tr}\Big[v\chi^\lambda(\omega)-v\chi^{KS}(\omega)\Big],

and the RPA approximation for correlation energies is simply obtained from the RPA approximation for the response function. From the point of view of TDDFT, the response function can be expressed exactly in terms of the Kohn-Sham response function and the exchange-correlation kernel :math:`f_{xc}`:

.. math::

  \chi^\lambda(\omega) = \chi^KS(\omega) + \chi^KS(\omega)\Big[\lambda v+f_{xc}^\lambda(\omega)\Big]\chi^\lambda(\omega).

The RPA is obtained by neglecting the exchange-correlation kernel and it should be possible to improve RPA by including simple approximations for this kernel. However, if one tries to use a simple adiabatic kernel, one encounters severe convergence problems and results become worse than RPA! The reason for this is that the locality of adiabatic kernels renders the pair-correlation function divergent. As it turns out, the adiabatic correlation hole can be renormalized by a simple non-empirical procedure, which results in a density-dependent non-locality in the kernel. This can be done for any adiabatic kernel and the method has implemented for LDA and PBE. We refer to these approximations as renormalized adiabatic LDA (rALDA) and renormalized adiabatic PBE (rAPBE). We only include the exchange part of the kernel, since this part is linear in :math:`\lambda` and the kernel thus only needs to be evaluated for :math:`\lambda=1`.

For more details on the theory and implementation of RPA we refer to :ref:`rpa` and the tutorial :ref:`rpa_tut`. The RPA tutorial should be studied before the present tutorial, which inherits much of the terminology from RPA. Details on the theory, implementation and benchmarking of the renormalized kernels can be found in Refs. [#Olsen1]_, [#Olsen2]_, and [#Olsen3]_.

Below we give examples on how to calculate the correlation energy of a Hydrogen atom as well as the rAPBE atomization energy of a :math:`CO` molecule and the rAPBE cohesive energy of diamond. Note that some of the calculations in this tutorial will need a lot of CPU time and is essentially not possible without a supercomputer.

Example 1: Correlation energy of the Hydrogen atom
==================================================

As a first demonstration of the deficiencies of RPA, we calculate the correlation energy of a Hydrogen atom. The exact correlation energy should vanish for any one-electron system. The calculations can be performed with the script

.. literalinclude:: hydrogen.py

which also give the LDA and PBE correlation energies. The script takes on the order of one hour, but the computationally heavy RPA/rALDA/rAPBE parts can be parallelized efficiently on multiple CPUs. Note that a rather small unit cell is used and the results may not be completely converged with respect to cutoff and unit cell. Also note that the correlation energy is calculated at different cutoff energies up to 300 eV and the values based on two-point extrapolation is printed at the end (see :ref:`rpa_tut` :ref:`rpa` for a discussion on extrapolation). The results in eV are summarized below.

=====   =======   ======
 LDA    RPA       rALDA 
=====   =======   ======
-0.56    -0.55    -0.029
=====   =======   ======

=====   =======    ======
PBE     RPA        rAPBE
=====   =======    ======
-0.16    -0.55     -0.007
=====   =======    ======

The fact that RPA gives such a dramatic underestimation of the correlation energy is a general problem with the method, which is also seen for bulk systems. For example, for the homogeneous electron gas RPA underestimates the correlation energy by ~0.5 eV per electron for a wide range of densities. 
 
Example 2: Atomization energy of CO
===================================

Although RPA severely underestimates absolute correlation energies in general, energy differences are often of decent quality due to extended error cancellation. Nevertheless, RPA tends to underbind and performs slightly worse than PBE for atomization energies of molecules. The following example shows that rAPBE not only corrects the absolute correlation energies, but also performs better than RPA for atomization energies.

First we set up a ground state calculation with lots of unoccupied bands. This is done with the script:

.. literalinclude:: gs_CO.py

which takes on the order of 6-7 CPU hours. The script generates CO.gpw, C.gpw and O.gpw which are the input to the rAPBE calculation. The PBE and non-selfconsistent Hartree-Fock atomization energies are also calculated and written to the file PBE_HF_CO.dat. Next we calculate the RPA and rAPBE energies with the script

.. literalinclude:: rapbe_CO.py

The results for various cutoffs are written to the files rpa_CO.dat and rapbe_CO.dat. We also print the correlation energies of the C atom to be used in a tutorial below. As in the case of RPA the converged result is obtained by extrapolation using the script 

.. literalinclude:: extrapolate_CO.py

If pylab is installed, the plot=False can be change to plot=True to visualize the quality of the extrapolation. The final results are displayed below

======   =====   =====   ======       ============
PBE      HF      RPA     rAPBE        Experimental
======   =====   =====   ======       ============
11.71    7.36    10.60    11.31         11.23
======   =====   =====   ======       ============

Example 3: Cohesive energy of diamond
=====================================
The error cancellation in RPA works best when comparing systems with similar electronic structure. In the case of cohesive energies of solids where the bulk energy is compared to the energy of isolated atoms, RPA becomes even worse than for atomization energies of molecules. Here we illustrate this for the cohesive energy of diamond and show that the rAPBE approximation corrects the problem. The initial orbitals are obtained with the script

.. literalinclude:: gs_diamond.py

which takes roughly 5 minutes. The script generates diamond.gpw and uses a previous calculation of the C atom to calculate the EXX and PBE cohesive energies that are written to PBE_HF_diamond.dat. The RPA and rAPBE correlation energies are obtained with the script:

.. literalinclude:: rapbe_diamond.py

This takes on the order of 30 CPU hours, but can be parallelized efficiently. Finally the correlation part of the cohesive energies are obtained by extrapolation with the script

.. literalinclude:: extrapolate_diamond.py

The results are summarized below

====   ====   ====   ======       ============
PBE     HF     RPA    rAPBE       Experimental
====   ====   ====   ======       ============
7.75   5.17   7.04     7.61             7.55
====   ====   ====   ======       ============

As anticipated, RPA severly underestimates the cohesive energy, while PBE performs much better, and rAPBE comes very close to the experimental value.
