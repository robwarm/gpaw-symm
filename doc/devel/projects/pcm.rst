Polarizable continuum model (PCM)
=================================

:Who:
    Alexander Held

A polarizable continuum model according to [1]_ is being implemented
(still to be checked into the repository).

Recent features:

* extend bmgs solver to deal with global coefficients
* new poisson solver for poisson equation with dielectric
* cavity from van der Waals radii
* calculate surface energy from cavity

Planned features:

* forces
* charged systems
* cavity from density cut-off
