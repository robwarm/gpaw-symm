"""This module is an example of good coding style.

This docstring should begin with a one-line description followed by a
blank line, and then this paragraph describing in more word what kind
of functionality this module implements.

After this docstring we have import statements in this order:

1. From the Python standard library.
2. Other libraries (numpy, ase, ...).
3. GPAW stuff.

        section can be left out and the arguments can be described in
        the section folowing the headline and blank line (see the

            Name of the example.
        shape:  tuple
